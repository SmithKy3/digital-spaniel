# Specification

## (More for me to keep checking as I work but I guess it also shows how I think I've met each ask when you're reading over this)

### The top navigation section should be sticky, however when the user scrolls down a certain amount of pixels, the header should slide up and then slide down when the user scrolls up

### The "Services" menu item shows the hover/active state

### The header area should be full screen on desktop and collapse to a hamburger menu on tablet and mobile viewports which slides in/out when clicked

### For links (e.g. Let's Talk" add a hover animation of your choosing

### The "What are we capable of" shows the hover state on "Brand Strategy"

### "Some of our recent projects" shows a tabbed slider section. Animation for slider and tabs of your choosing. Image hover state shown on "Make Ideas Happen" project

### "Case Studies" slider section shows an active Case Study and two further Case Studies to the left and right which are accessed using the arrow buttons

### "What are we all about?" section shows a masonry gallery - finale image layout can be adjusted

### The testimonial slider section shows the active slide, with further sliders accessed using the circle buttons

### All links and buttons should have a hover/active/visited state where appropriate

### No tablet or mobile visuals are provided, so stack, reduce content where appropriate inline with best practice

### All assets should be available via the XD Development link, the logo is attached to this email
